                <p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.</p>

                <p>Whenever I feel bored, I turn on the music player on my mobile phone.

                    I have a huge collection of different music, and this makes more interesting and exciting to listen to the music. My parents often get irritated to see me listening to the music.
                    
                    However, my dad is very fond of listening to the music himself, and appreciates me for my hobby listening music. It has been years, since it has become my hobby. And, truly speaking, I really do not know since when it became my prime interest. I also own an iPad, and it also has a huge collection of variety of music. Among the large collection, the Bollywood and the Pop music are the two top ones.</p>
